class write_pwm:
    """
    Steers a Parallax Feedback 360° High-Speed Servo `360_data_sheet`_ .

    This class steers a Parallax Feedback 360° High-Speed Servo. Out of the speed range,
    defined by ``min_speed`` and ``max_speed``, and the range of the pulsewidth, defined 
    by ``min_pw`` and ``max_pw``, the class allows setting the servo speed and automatically
    calculates the appropriate pulsewidth for the chosen speed value.

    .. note::
        ``min_pw`` and ``max_pw`` might needed to be interchanged, depending on if ``min_pw`` is 
        moving the servo max_forward/clockwise or max_backwards/counter-clockwise,
        see methods :meth:`max_forward` and  :meth:`max_backward`. 
        :meth:`max_forward` -> ``min_pw`` should let the servo rotate clockwise.

    .. warning::
        Be carefull with setting the min and max pulsewidth! Test carefully ``min_pw`` and ``max_pw``
        before setting them. Wrong values can damage the servo, see set_servo_pulsewidth_ !!!

    Calibrates a Parallax Feedback 360° High-Speed Servo with the help of the :class:`read_pwm` class.

    This class helps to find out the min and max duty cycle of the feedback signal of a 
    servo. This values ( ``dcMin`` / ``dcMax`` ) are then needed in :ref:`lib_motion` 
    to have a more precise measurement of the position. The experience has shown that each
    servo has slightly different min/max duty cycle values, different than the once 
    provided in the data sheet 360_data_sheet_ . Values smaller and bigger than the 
    printed out once as "duty_cycle_min/duty_cycle_max" are outliers and should 
    therefore not be considered. This can be seen in the printouts of smallest/biggest 
    250 values. There are sometimes a few outliers. Compare the printouts of different
    runs to get a feeling for it.

    .. note::
        The robot wheels must be able to rotate free in the air for calibration.
        Rotating forward or backward might sometimes give slightly 
        different results for min/max duty cycle. Choose the smallest value and the 
        biggest value out of the forward and backward runs. Do both directions three 
        times for each wheel, with speed = 0.2 and -0.2. Then 
        chose the values. The speed has to be set manually, see :ref:`Examples`.
